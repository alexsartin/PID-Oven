# PID-Oven
- Control and automate temperature curves of resistance based ovens with termopar and PID controller
- Automate the solder reflow preocess to integrate electrical components into circuit boards.


# Hardware
* Arduino
* Thermopar Shield
* Zero-cross Shield
* Triac Shield


# Interface
Uses and Google Chrome application to set and view the temperature profile.
The application communicates with the Arduino micro-controller via USB cable.
